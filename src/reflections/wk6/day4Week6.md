What is a nested route?

A route that allows for more complex user interfaces with components to be nested inside each other.

When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

If you had multiple components you want to display like secondary info. Essentailly when you want children that contain multiple layers of info, or want them to include the params and info from the parent.

Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes, in addition to query the parent passes value to the child. There are cases for params to pass the value to the child. Basically if you want to have the children have the same info as the parent you would use them.
