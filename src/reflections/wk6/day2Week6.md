What are props?

Props are how we pass varables and other info around between different components.

What are props used for?

We pass props to another component, and that component can then use that value.

Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can be used inside the template, but the real power is using them in methods. They can be used in Watchers,lifecycle hooks, methods, computed props, and anywhere else in the component definition
