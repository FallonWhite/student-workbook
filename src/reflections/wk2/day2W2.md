What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

I'm not sure of what this question is asking. There are three ways to define a function: Function declaration, function expression, and generator function. A function declaration has three parts, Name, Parameters, and Statements. The way a function is written can determine what the function actually does, and what it returns. You can write a simple function, or complex, based on what it's job is. 

What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are variables defined by a function that receive a value. An argument is the data passed when the function is called.

What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A higher order function receives a function as an argument, returning function as output. It has multi-levels, so it can take another function as an input or it can give back a function as an output.
