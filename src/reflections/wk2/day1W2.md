What is Scope ?

Scope determines the accessibility of variables. Block, function, and global.

What is Hoisting ?

JavaScript's default behavior of moving declartions to the top.

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

I would use var to declare a variable outside of a function, to be used globaly. I know it can be used within a fanction block, but I would prefer to use let. I would use let within a function block. I'm still a little foggy as to why I would use const since it's not initialized and can't ne updated or redeclared. I suppose it would be best used in an instance that I had already used var and let, and wanted to avoid a potential issue down the line by using an unchangable declaration.
