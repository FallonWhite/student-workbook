What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

There are multiple things you can write info to the console that can be used to test code, to identify errors, to count, to track etc. 

Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML, and can be used to identify errors. You can make changes in order to trouble shoot, and test changes without altering your code in VS.

Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

You can use a debug tool, apply a debug to your styles, and use the errors within the inspection area in the localhost of your code.
