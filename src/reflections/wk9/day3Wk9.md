How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

The number of meetings change, the sprint lengths may differ, the number of standups and time alloted may differ when working in a small team.

Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

In order to maximize communication, limit issues, to help stay on track for time to deliver.

What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

Good service Cheap won't be Fast. Good service Fast won't be Cheap. Fast service Cheap won't be Good. The paradox is the set of tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of the software delivered. Scrum comes in when it comes to balancing those, and maximizing the efficiency of a team.
