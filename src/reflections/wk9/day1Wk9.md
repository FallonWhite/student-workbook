What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

SOLID, CRUD, agile, trello, among others.

What went well so far?

Simplistic design, under-promise but over-deliver type of mindset, straight-forward approach, and overall team mindset in terms of communication.

What would you do differently? Why?

Sticky notes on whiteboards. I would probably use a different API.
