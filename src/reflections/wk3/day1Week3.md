What problem does using exports solve?

Using export grants access to a module in another module, otherwise files stay local and cannot be accessed in other modules. 

How does export differ from export default?

Export allows you to export all modules, whereas export default allows you to just export the values you need.

What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Cleaner code, avoid naming conflicts, smaller files (easier to debug), and code organization are all benefits of using a Module System.
