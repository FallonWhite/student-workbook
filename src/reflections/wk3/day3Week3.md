What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Get, and set

What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?

The default implementation of the get operator is to return the value stored in that key in the Object. This custom override that we provided for get is called a trap

What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Proxies were introduced in ES6 to allow you to provide custom functionality to basic operations that can be performed on an Object.
