What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pairing up to work on a project. One is  a driver, the other is the navigator, and they switch off.

What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

increased code quality: "programming out loud" leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of error or going down blind alleys
better diffusion of knowledge among the team, in particular when a developer unfamiliar with a component is pairing with one who knows it much better
better transfer of skills, as junior developers pick up micro-techniques or broader skills from more experienced team members
large reduction in coordination efforts, since there are N/2 pairs to coordinate instead of N individual developers
improved resiliency of a pair to interruptions, compared to an individual developer: when one member of the pair must attend to an external prompt, the other can remains focused on the task and can assist in regaining focus afterwards

What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Cost associated from an employer perspective. Also, if the partner pairing is wrong the work can suffer, the end result can turn out poor, it can take more time to complete, there can be frustration that wouldn't exist working solo. There are likely more drawbacks to partner programming than going solo, unless you find the perfect pairing that gets to work together frequently so they understand and work well with each others working/learning/teaching style.
