What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

The experience the user will have while using your site. While coding you always have to be aware of how your code will impact the end user. How will they feel while looking at the design, layout etc, how easy will it be to navigate, does your code provide an intuitive user experience... Those are all important things to consider when coding. It's not just about making code work, it's about making it usable.

What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

It helps with planning, layout, and design. Often we know thet we can write code several ways, but by thinking of the user and their experience we can narrow down to the best way to write in order to give the user a positive experience. By seeing code not as just something we do, but as part of a bigger picture we gain a better understanding of what we are doing, what we need to do, and the why behind it.

Why is the User Experience important?

I feel like between the two answers above, I've already answered this, but it's important because we want the user to have a positive or at least not a frustrating experience. WE want them to want to use our project - pretty straight forward.
