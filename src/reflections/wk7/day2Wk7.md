What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Documentation to help understand the code at a later date, or for someone who didn't write the code to be able to understand what's going on. 

There are many ways for documenting a piece of code. For example you can write:

howtos guides for using your code
a nice README for the repo
code documentation in the source

What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

Reference for the person who wrote it when they go back to the project later. Instructions/understanding for the next person who may work on the code if it's handeed off. If there's an issue with functionality down the road documenting the how's and why's will help with debugging

How important is Code documentation and why?

Having approached writing code from both avenues - using and not using notes within the code, I have to say that it greatly helped with larger projects. I won't be returning to the days of not making notes in m code. Often writing happens for several hours at a time and you can get lost in the work, so if you make notes about questions, or maybe you have other ideas on how to approach the same line of code you can make notes so that when you come back to it you get refreshed on what you were thinking or doing at the time. In other words, it's extremely important for me personally.
