Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I didn't get a chance to read the week material until after the project, but we implemented the partner pairing, and I definitely took into account the user experience while coding.

What went well?

Honestly not much. It was nice to work with someone who was patient, kind, respectful, and was a good partner, but there were a lot of issues tha came up. Documenting within the code did benefit the project. Even thought the site didn't have many working functions, it did feel nice from a user experience, in terms of it making sense and being easy to navigate, once it was completed I'm confident that the user experience wouldn't have been a negative one.

What would you do differently?

I would have more knowledge going in. I don't really know what we could have done differently. It basicall came down to neither of us having the knowledge to complete the project in the time that we were given. WOuld have been better to be able to devote more time to learning prior to the project.
