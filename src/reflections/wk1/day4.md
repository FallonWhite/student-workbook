What is the purpose of wire-framing?
It allows you to see the repesentation of the webpage, so that you can be more purposeful in your design. It can act as a guide.

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low, medium, and high fidelity. 
Low fidelity is good for getting a quick outline made if you just need a rough starting place. Best if you need to work quickly.
Medium is good for creating a map that may include more complex, or detailed designs/projects.
High is good for dialing in finishing details, like when you need to work on functionality.

Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I think they are worth it. I'm already learning about the importance for me personally. It's great to have a plan when starting a project. Distractions may arise, moods change, memories face etc. It's more efficient to invest the time to stay on track. If there are colaborators sharing a project, it's especially important to ensure that misunderstandings are minimized, and that the main things have been communicated and agreed upon.
