What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
I like the idea of using Figma to figure out the ideal layout, and the overall feel of the design

Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
If I was working on a project I would search bootswatch for theme ideas. I would also take into consideration what I am working on, and research some popular websites to see how each made me feel. I don't know what "resources" I would use just yet; 
I would just pull ideas from things and sites that I like.

How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I think that a design can make or break a company who relies heavily on online traffic. I want to feel a certain way when I'm browsing sites; if I'm frustrated due to layout, user-friendliness, or the color-combinations bother me, I find an elternative to that site. I want to feel at ease and confident about using the site. 

When sites are poorly designed not only is it frustrating or possibly jarring, but it gives off the vibe that the company or maker just doesn't care enough to make a real effort. Personally, I'm far less trusting in the authenticity, and trustworthiness when a design is poor.
