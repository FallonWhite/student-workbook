What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
A pseudo-class is a keyword used to specify the state of an element. By adding a pseudo-class devs can give an element a characteristic. I need to gain a better understanding in order to weigh in on which I would most likely use, but I'm thinking that the selector I would use most would be :link, to make an element clickable, or :hover, to make an element change color when a mouse is hovering over it.

What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
The !important feature can make debugging more difficult, and can cause an issue with existing styles within CSS. I think that we should get in the habit of stylizing without needing to use the kind of override that could potentially cause more issues, and work than necessary.
