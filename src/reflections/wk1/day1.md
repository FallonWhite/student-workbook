In your own words, why do we use Git?
We used Git so that muliple developers can write code without conflict; it allows mupliple devs to work on the same project, or use the same source.

What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Branches allow multiple versions of a project. By utilizing branches developers can make changes to different branches without impacting all versions.

What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
GitHub is a place to store projects. GitHub allows devs to push and/or pull code to be used, altered, or shared. While it is used for storing, it is also used to showcase devs portfolio. While Git is used as a control and distribution system. One is used to make changes, to control, while the other is used as a storage and resource location.
