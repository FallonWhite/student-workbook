What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or “appending,” that information to the end of a URL. This information is stored in the query string and is captured by the website when it reads the URL.

What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

{ a: '1', b: '2' }, which appears with & to join each. It starts after the ? in the strong, or with the {}. You can distinguish between them by the & in the strong, or by the , in the code.

When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

They would be helpful when handling multiple parameters, or large amounts of data.
