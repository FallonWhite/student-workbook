What are the three types of relationships?

One-To-One (1:1) relationship. One-To-Many (1:N). Many-To-Many (N:M).

What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding

I don't know. They don't make enough sense to me to be able to fully differenciate. Seems like embedding would make it more challenging to access when trying to link multiple things.

What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

The subject of many-to-many is a struggle. It seems to complex to fully utilize where my understanding currently is. All I have found is that it's important to map out the relationships and deciding how things are related prior to doing any coding.
