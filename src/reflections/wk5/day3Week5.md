In simple terms what is a sub-document?

Subdocuments are documents that are nested in other documents

When might you use a sub-document?

When you have multiple models/schemas it may be necessary to nest another schema within an existing one.

How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? What about editing them?

Create your main schema, then add the sub-documents after. The same would apply to editing them. Find the sub document and apply changes.
