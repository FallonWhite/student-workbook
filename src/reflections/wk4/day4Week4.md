What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. When a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API.

What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

I don't really understand this question so I'm going to hope what's being looked for is what it does. 
Fetch, and return while adhering to 6 constraints:
Uniform interface, Client --- server separation, Stateless, Layered system, Cacheable, Code-on-demand.
