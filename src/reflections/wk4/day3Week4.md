What is the purpose of Async/Await?

Async functions are a combination of promises and generators, and basically, they are a higher level abstraction over promises. Async function returns a promise; when you want to call this function you prepend await, and the calling code will stop until the promise is resolved or rejected.

What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

The client function must be defined as async.

What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

Debugging promises is hard because the debugger will not step over asynchronous code. Async/await makes this very easy because to the compiler it's just like synchronous code.
