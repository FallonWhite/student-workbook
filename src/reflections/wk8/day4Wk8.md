What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing allows you to test individual units of code in isolation. 
Component Testing. End-To-End (E2E) Testing

What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

End to end, but all the methods are useful. The first two are valuable, but in the end they don't provide the answer on how the app will work for the end user.

What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I don't know, honestly. Maybe the component testing because it may be less relevant to every project. I'm trying to gain a better grasp on the how's and why's, but at first glance it may be the only one that if I was on a really tight timeline I may be willing to skip, but that could be because I don't understand the importance just yet from a theoretical aspect.
