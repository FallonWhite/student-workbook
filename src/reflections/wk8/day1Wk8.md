What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Creating a portfolio that has diverse projects, using different languages is the most effective. Devs want to choose projects that showcase their skill, and adaptability. 

What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I have an existing project that I would like to continue to build upon, or rather expand; the openTrivia app would be one that I would like to create a new db for and enter trivia for more mythos. I would create more functionality of the site as well as expanding the trivia categories. If I put in some more work on the BugLog that might be one that I would include. I am going to start a mobile app that will start as a tarot card app, but will be expanded upon. I want to mostly focus on marketing myself as a designer with a focus on mobile.
