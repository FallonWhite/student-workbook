What is Software Development Testing?

A way to test without having to take the time to install app, log in, and go through the issues without having to take the time to go through additional steps each time you reach a bug or potential issue. Component testing makes sure each piece of a larger system works as intended.

What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

I feel like I basically answered that in the above question. Really what it comes down to is being able to know what works and wha doesn't prior to "using" the software. You want to be able to know that what you have already built is good to go so that if an issue comes up when you go to use the software you can narrow down where the issue is coming from.

What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

The need to take the time between steps. Leaving their comfort zone. Questioning yourself and skill could also come into play. Possible disruption to your "flow" in terms of breaking focus when you are on a coding roll.
