What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values. Enums lend themselves to more maintainable code because they are symbolic, allowing you to work with integral values but using a meaningful name to do so. Enums make working with strongly typed constants via symbolic names easy.

How can you modify an Enum?

Enums are immutable, the ordinal and name fields are final. If you want to modify an Enum you have to actually change the value, modify it directly.

How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?-if you have not yet, give an example of how you could

I haven't used it in an afternnon project, but I did use it in the SPrintr checkpoint. It ws part of an API field.
