What is a List in C#?

It's a generic type. A way to list or basically reference types for use or manipulation.

What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

I would think I'd most often use List.ForEach to go through a list and complete an action specified. Another one that may be used often would be List.Find to basically hunt down the occurance, or List.FindAll as a quick way to pull in all the instances. 

How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

I don't think I quite understand what's being asked. There are a lot of ways to return items from a list, like the ones I mentioned in the above answer, such as List.Find, List.FindAll, but I'm unsure if you're asking for a return function type of answer of just which method I'd use. 

Afternoon: I got sick and was struggling in class. I watched the Udemy dotnet videos during lab time, hoping to gain a better grasp to apply to other lab assignments. I got 45% through the module https://www.udemy.com/course/dotnet-core-101/learn/lecture/16368700?start=15#overview
